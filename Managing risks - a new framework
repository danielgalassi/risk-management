#Managing Risks: A new Framework#

Internal risks originate from within the organization and are manageable, warranting elimination or prevention.
These encompass misconduct and operational process disruptions.
Establishing a permissible margin for minor flaws or mishaps, which won't inflict substantial harm, is a sensible approach.
Nevertheless, the primary objective should be risk eradication, as these hazards offer no strategic advantages.

Handle this risk category prioritising proactive measures such as continuous monitoring of operational processes and influencing individuals to align their behaviors and decisions with established norms.
